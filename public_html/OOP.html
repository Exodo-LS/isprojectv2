      <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to use a common interface for multiple forms</h4>
      <p>The part of my calculator_v2 project that would represent Polymorphism would be in <i>calc_test.py</i>. The
        rationale behind my logic is that I can create multiple tuples that are used in the same function call.
        Theoretically, I can run addition or any other operation as many times as I want through <i>calc_test.py</i> and
        that will keep providing me with new values for the results. I even added a new method to validate the process.
        Therefore, the entire <i>calc_test.py</i> file serves as a means of Polymorphism.</p>

      <br>
      <img class="tutpng" src="img/polymorphism2.png" alt="Result of Pytest">
      <p>With the pictures given, the "test_calc_polymorphism" function was made to prove that I can make two separate
      tuples that can run the same math operation. In my case, I used addition since it was easier. However, that
      testing can be applied to the other operation. The pylint check validates that there is no error with both tuples
      be added. I do believe that concept works in <i>history_test.py</i> with the function that can remove a value
      from the list of calculation.</p>

    <div class="ghtxt">
      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it</h4>
      <p>The part of my calculator_v2 project that would represent Inheritance would be in the <u>operations directory
      </u>. This directory possesses all the operations including <i>calculations.py</i>. This file is what takes in the
        tuples that are inputted. It is the addition class from <i>addition.py</i> that would use the tuples from the
        calculations class from the <i>calculations.py</i> file. The same applies for all the other operations in that
        directory.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <img class="tutpng" src="img/Inhertitance2.png" alt="Snippet of code from addition.py">
      <p>The pictures depicts the process to complete a given operation. When <i>calc_test.py</i> runs the addition
      operation, the addition class will send the tuple over to the calculations class for addition to be able to add
      the values with the tuple. The addition class inherits the values with the tuple from the calculations class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ghtxt">
      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevents direct modification of data</h4>
      <p>As seen from the sections prior, the calculator_v2 project possesses attributes of Object-Oriented Programming.
      This section is no different. This section is about Encapsulation, but what part of my code protects data from
      direct modification? It is quite simple because that lies in the operations the return the value. The tuples are
        taken and perform the desired operation, and we get the result. Yet, we cannot modify that result. While those
        values can be purged from the history list, it's the history list that is getting modified. Therefore, those
      result values are never modified. </p>
      <img class="tutpng" src="img/Encapsulation1.png" alt="Snippet of code from addition.py">
      <p>Yes it is the same picture used in the Inheritance section. The sum that is generated is accessed or modified.
        It is stored in a list that contains the sum. The list can remove the value from itself which indirectly
      modifies the sum to not exist.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <div class="ghtxt">
      <h3>Abstraction</h3>
      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the unnecessary details from the users</h4>
      <p>The last attribute to talk about in Object-Oriented Programming is Abstraction. Although my files do not
        possess abstract classes or methods, it does do a good job at displaying what is needed. This is mainly evident
      in both <i>calc_test.py</i> and <i>history_test.py</i>. Both files just show the user that do math operations and
      modify the history list. Thus, it makes both files not very complex.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <img class="tutpng" src="img/Abstraction2.png" alt="Snippet from calculations.py from the history directory">
      <p>The level of complexity increases when having to keep track of what each function does when a user does not
      understand what the programmer made. At one point, both testing files were merged into one file. The same applies
      for the <i>calculate.py</i> and <i>calculations.py</i> from the history directory. Although I know how to easily
      maneuver that code, a simple user would not understand and simply not use the program due to its high level
      of complexity.</p>
